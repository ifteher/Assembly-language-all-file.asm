//Explanation of Corrections
Segment Declarations:

@data was correctly used, but ensure the .model small directive is present to declare the memory model.
String Display:

Strings must end with $ for DOS interrupt int 21h, function 9 to display correctly. Your string definition is correct.
New Line:

For proper formatting, the order of carriage return (CR = 13) and line feed (LF = 10) is swapped to maintain compatibility with DOS conventions.
Loop Logic:

The loop logic was syntactically correct. However, ensure CX is properly decremented using loop.
Program Termination:

The exit code mov ah, 4Ch with int 21h was correct. It ensures the program exits cleanly in a DOS environment.
Comments:

Improved clarity of comments to explain each step concisely.
